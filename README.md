# MkDocs Dockerize
#### Simple Dockerize Method For MkDocs Project V0.1

#### Overview
MkDocs is a fast, simple and downright gorgeous static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation. Documentation source files are written in Markdown, and configured with a single YAML configuration file.

#### Host Anywhere
MkDocs builds completely static HTML sites that you can host on GitHub pages, Amazon S3, or anywhere else you choose.

#### Great Themes Available
There's a stack of good looking themes available for MkDocs. Choose between the built in themes: mkdocs and readthedocs, select one of the 3rd party themes in the MkDocs wiki, or build your own.

#### Preview Your Site as You Work
The built-in dev-server allows you to preview your documentation as you're writing it. It will even auto-reload and refresh your browser whenever you save your changes.

#### Easy to Customize
Get your project documentation looking just the way you want it by customizing the theme.
